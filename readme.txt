A simple interface to edit or delete Custom Fields.

== Description ==

**Note:** This plugin does *not* work as expected past version 0.1.1. Work is being done to remedy this.

This plugin offers a simple interface to edit or delete any Custom Field names/keys you may have created in the post/page editor.

Deleting a Custom Field *also* deletes the associated content, so use with caution!

This is not meant to be a powerful plugin in the vein of [Advanced Custom Fields](http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/).

Only users with role Editor and above have access to this plugin.
